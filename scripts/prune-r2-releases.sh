# Prune old NovaGitX release artifacts from the R2 (S3-compatible) bucket,
# keeping only the newest KEEP versions. Run after a release publishes.
#
# Why keep 2 and not 1: electron-updater's differential download needs the
# *previous* version's .blockmap to delta-patch from N-1 to N. Keeping the
# last two versions preserves delta updates; older versions are dead weight.
#
# Artifact naming (from electron-builder.cjs):
#   NovaGitX-<ver>-<arch>-mac.dmg[.blockmap]   (macOS disk image + delta map)
#   NovaGitX-<ver>-<arch>-mac.zip[.blockmap]   (macOS zip - used by the updater)
# All of the above carry an X.Y.Z, so they are pruned by version.
#
# Unversioned keys are NEVER touched:
#   latest-mac.yml / latest-mac-arm64.yml   (update manifests, overwritten each build)
# A key with no extractable X.Y.Z is skipped by design - that is the safety net
# protecting the manifests.
#
# Env (set by CI):
#   R2_RELEASES_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_RELEASES_BUCKET
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# Optional:
#   KEEP     number of versions to retain (default 2)
#   DRY_RUN  "1" to print deletions without executing (default 0)
